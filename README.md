# PolyLearner API

A comprehensive task and learning management system designed to help you organize your work with weekly goals, track task reviews, and measure progress through structured reviews. Built with FastAPI and MongoDB.

## 🎯 Overview

PolyLearner is a RESTful API that enables you to:

- **Create and manage tasks** with categories, time estimates, and goals
- **Organize work into weekly goals** with associated task groups and reviews
- **Track task reviews** with focus rate, artifact links, and completion status
- **Capture weekly reviews** to measure progress and improve planning

## ✨ Key Features

### Task Management
- Create tasks with:
  - Title, category (research, coding, admin, networking)
  - Time estimates in hours
  - Goal description
  - Artifact type (article, notes, code)
  - Link to a weekly goal (optional)
  - Task review (embedded in task document)

### Weekly Goals
- Create weekly goals with:
  - Week number (1–53)
  - Goal description text
  - Associated task IDs (auto-tracked)
  - Weekly review (separate collection)

### Reviews
- **Task Reviews**: Embedded in task documents
  - Notes, focus rate (1–10), artifact URL, completion status (yes/no)
- **Weekly Reviews**: Separate collection
  - Weekly goal reviews with goal linkage
  - Full review metadata stored separately for querying

### REST API
- Swagger UI at `/` for interactive API exploration
- Full CRUD operations for tasks, weekly goals, and reviews
- MongoDB persistence with async Motor driver

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

- **FastAPI** (v0.109.0): Modern Python web framework
- **Motor** (v3.6.0): Async MongoDB driver
- **MongoDB**: Document-based NoSQL database
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: Containerization and orchestration
- **Python 3.11**: Runtime

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Python 3.11+ (for local development)
- Git (optional, for version control)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

1. **Clone or navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/loki/polylearner
   ```

2. **Set environment (optional):**
   ```bash
   export APP_ENV=dev  # or 'prod'
   ```

3. **Build and run:**
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

4. **Access the API:**
   - Swagger UI: [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)
   - Health check: [http://localhost:8000/health](http://localhost:8000/health)
   - Info endpoint: [http://localhost:8000/info](http://localhost:8000/info)

### Local Development

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r app/requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Ensure MongoDB is running** (either locally or via Docker):
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 27017:27017 mongo:7
   ```

3. **Set environment variables:**
   ```bash
   export APP_ENV=dev
   export MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017
   export MONGO_DB=polylearner
   ```

4. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   cd app
   python app.py
   ```

   Or with auto-reload:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app:app --reload
   ```

### Code Organization
```

## 📝 Logging

- **Log level**: INFO (adjustable in `app.py`)
- **Handlers**:
  - Console output (stdout)
  - File output (`app.log`)
- **Format**: `timestamp - logger_name - level - message`

## 🔐 Security Notes

- CORS is currently open (`allow_origins=["*"]`)
- For production, restrict CORS to specific domains
- MongoDB runs without authentication (configure in production)
- Validate all inputs before persisting to database

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### MongoDB Connection Fails
- Ensure `mongo` service is running: `docker compose ps`
- Check `MONGO_URI` matches your setup
- Verify network connectivity between app and mongo containers

### Port Already in Use
- Change port bindings in `docker-compose.yml`:
  ```yaml
  ports:
    - "8001:8000"  # App on 8001
    - "27018:27017"  # Mongo on 27018
  ```

### Module Not Found Error
- Ensure dependencies are installed:
  ```bash
  pip install -r app/requirements.txt
  ```

## 📚 Future Enhancements

Based on the requirements, consider adding:
- Energy/focus analytics per task
- Task grouping by mental expenditure
- Distraction tracking and backlog
- Cross-domain skill graphs
- Habit tracking and behavior analytics
- Integration with external tools (Obsidian, etc.)
