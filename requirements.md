**Task rules**
- Each task must have strict time
- Map out strict tasks for the week that fulfill the weakly goal
- Give the system your commitments, highlight non negoitable tasks abs vice versa
- The system must go through all tasks, group them by mental expenditure then schedule or cluster them

** Energy rules**
- All tasks that require a lot of mental commitment must be done during peak energy times(This might have to come later)
- ultradian cycles must be used 90-120 minutes per tasks with 30 minute breaks
- During a task if you feel distracted or bored it must be captured

**Distractions**
- Jot down any distractions as tasks to be looked at later and this will go to the backlog
- recommend focus times based on feedback( this is for later)

**Weekly Review**
- schedule weekly review where you measure the goal set vs what was done
- review strategy, wins and challenges
- This must be used for improving the next week planning
