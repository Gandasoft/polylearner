tarts with how to approach your time and creating an environment both mental and physical 
3 critical steps:
adopting a proactive mindset: proactive mindset is the lens through which you'll view challenges as opportunities and setbacks as learning experiences. It's about taking ownership of your time and choices, rather than feeling at the mercy of external circumstances. 
 creating a conducive environment: Your physical and digital spaces have a profound impact on your focus and efficiency. By optimizing these areas, you create external cues that support your internal drive for productivity.
 setting clear intentions: setting clear intentions acts as your compass, guiding your actions and decisions throughout the week. When you have a crystal-clear vision of what you want to achieve, it becomes easier to prioritize tasks and stay motivated, even when faced with distractions or obstacles.
It's about defining not just what you want to achieve, but why it matters to you.
Instead of waiting for the "perfect" conditions, you create them. Embracing responsibility for your time means recognizing that you have the power to choose how you spend each moment.
In your physical workspace, this might mean decluttering, organizing materials for easy access, or creating a dedicated area for focused work.

feeling like you constantly busy but not archiving anything is a conflict between short term goals and what we wana do on a day to day
This alignment is about intentionally aligning your small details and decision working
how does daily task fulfill the bigger picture
Strive of concrete goals that you can break down to milestones to serve as check points
Use SMART goals
review long terms goals and ask yourself what can i do this week to achieve my goals
create KPIs to measure yourself they can n be quantitative (number of tasks completed ) or qualitative (improved skills proficiency)
goals should stretch but not break you

CHAPTER 3: Prioritize tasks:
the art of prioritization its the act of discerning what is truly important and what is not
time is a special resource you must maximum the use of it
importance is how significant to archiving your goals and urgent tasks are those that demand immediate attention
Eisenhower system helps prioritization of tasks
it breaks down tasks into 4 quadrants and has a clear focus on what tour need to focus on
pareto princ9iple is also known as 80/20 rule sys 20% tasks cover 80% results
Don't let urgent tasks overshadow important tasks, create a prioritized list
start by identifying each morning your top three priorities for the day , these should be tasks that if completed would make the day a success regardless of what else happens
experiment with tools that fit what you need
Effective prioritization is not about doing everything but doing what matters

Chapter 4: Time blocking:
allocating specific time slots to a specific task
imposing strict time constraints on tasks it helps enhance focus
Time blocking improves overall management and efficiency, forces you to be realistic and help avoid overcommitting the work 
start by designing your ideal week, step back and look at the big picture of your life and goals
start by mapping your non-negotiable weekly commitments things like work hours and family obligations and regular meetings.
Next consider how you want to allocate your time between work, rest and personal activities
make sure your block out time for self-care, hobbies and relationships
leave unscheduled time slot in your day to care for unforeseen circumstances
to avoid distractions during your focus time, set off notifications, set boundaries with colleagues   and set specific times for checking emails and messages
Another challenge is sticking to the plan make sure you maintain discipline and adhere to your schedule , commit to your process even when you dont feel like doing something
start by planning time for the upcoming week, begin with fixed commitments  then add blocks for your high priority tasks don't forget to add time breaks, personal activities and bufffer periods

task batching
It's a technique that challenges the way we typically approach our to-do lists, offering a smarter, more efficient alternative.
The mind is not created in a way to switch between tasks rapidly, each time you switch you pay a cognitive tax
When you batch activities you enhance focus on specific type of work,
switching between tasks is that makes you drained and less productive
start by identifying routine activities and batch them together
batch more complex activities e.g. batch writing tasks together with strategic planning activities
The next step is to create your task batches. This process involves organizing your tasks by type and the mental effort required. For example, you might create a batch for all your email-related tasks, another for phone calls, and yet another for creative work
within each match make sure you specify what the intended outcome is and avoiding distractions during batch work
Don't be afraid toe experiment with times and composition of the tasks  from batches might benefit from longer uninterrupted periods 
remain flexible and adjust your approach based on what works best for you
Steps:
list all activities for the next week
group them together according to mental focus, similarity
schedule these batches into your calendar creating dedicated time blocks for each group of tasks
As you implement these monitor your performance, pay attention to how quickly you complete tasks
if you find yourself getting bored it means overbatching or over they are not as similar as you think
the goal is to find a rythmn that works for your brain

Energy management
The key is harnessing the force that the ebbs and flows inside of you
This is about working in harmony with your natural body rythms
Our bodies operate on various cycles, including the well-known circadian rhythm that regulates our sleep-wake cycle, and the lesser-known ultradian rhythms that occur multiple times throughout the day. These rhythms influence our energy levels, cognitive function, and even our mood.
Learn to ride the wave like swimming
High energy periods are for high focus tasks and low energy ones are for resting or mandate
Circadian rhythm:  body clock is a 24-hour cycle that regulates various psychological processes
This is why you feel alert or sleepy at certain times of the day
You can master these cycles by tracking how alert you are or sluggish at certain times of the day
Ultradian rhythms are shorter cycles that occur multiple times throughout the day and involves 90–120-minute periods of high energy focus followed by 20-30 minutes lower energy 
the tasks the require creativity,intense focus, and coplex problem solving should be done at high energy periodsm its not about working longer its about working smarter
burnout are a sign of working outside of your energy rythms for  a longer period of time, keep your energy diary for a week
Be willing to adjust according to your energy levels if you feel energetic during a low energy task be willing to switch and vice versa

Eliminating distractions:
This is about creating an environment both internal and external to focus
This is about reclaiming your mental space to become deeply focus
Every time your switch tasks your mind partially remains of your previous task and this residue accumulates during the day
first step is to list the external and internal distractions
establish boundaries with other to avoid distractions
Mindful practices can help you become more aware of wondering thoughts and allowing you to gently redirect your focus back to the task at hand
quickly jot down any thoughts or worries that come to our head and get back to the task at hand
cultivate deep focus times during which you do constantly focus uninterrupted on one task our brain is used to constrant stimulation but practice to extend deep focus periods to unlock new levels of productivity and creativity
do a distraction audit where you log what distracted you and what triggered it

Weekly reflection:
The most powerful tool to productivity is the ability to take a pause and look back
structured internal process of looking at your week, this creates a feedback loop and help with continuous improvements 
experiential learning is when we learn on the mistakes we made and what we have done
review the goal of the week, how you intended to you achieve the goal and any problems that caused you not to
have you accomplished the intended goals?
if you have what elements played a role in your achievement?
if not, what obstacles got in your way?
This isn't about judgment but about gathering data every outcome whether +ve or -ve  contains valuable information
Did certain tasks take longer than intended? 
What was the root cause was it because of external factors or your habits?
Make this review a non-negotiable part of your week, schedule it into your week
